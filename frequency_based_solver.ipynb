    "# Frequency Based Solver\n",
    "The first iteration of this solver is using position based letter frequencies to determine the next best guess in a game of Wordle. The idea is that the best word to guess is the word remaining that is most likely to occur based on how often certain letters appear. It is agnostic of the green, yellow, and grey letters right now, and is only using the information from filtering the database (so indirectly affecting).\n",

    "From any given database, do guesses converge here? \n",

    "To-Do\n",
    "-> better metric for 'best word', need to calculate the stats on the max freq score (mean, stdev) and maybe recommend several words that are in close scor, but this is first attempt. "
